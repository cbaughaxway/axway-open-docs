## Summary

API Portal provides an API consumer-facing interface that you can customize to match your corporate brand. API Portal is a layered product linked to API Manager, and requires both API Manager and API Gateway. For more information, see the API Gateway and API Manager documentation.

## Installation

API Portal is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in a Docker container. For more information, see the following options:

* If you are installing API Portal for the first time using this update, see [Install API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/)
* If you are already using API Portal (7.5.x, 7.6.x, 7.7.x) and want to install this update, see [Upgrade API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/)
* If you want to deploy API Portal in Docker containers, see [Deploy API Portal in containers](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_docker/)

## New features and enhancements

### Non-root installer​

To expand compliance with many customers internal security guidelines, which discourage or disallow root access, we have added the ability to install and run API Portal using `sudo` commands.​ To learn more, watch [How to install API Portal without being a root user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5RZjP9Zl7k&list=PLSlCpG9zsECpo8-JMZ2Cx4REDyUvpwy9v)​.

### Easy upgrade from 7.5.x and 7.6.x​

With end of support for API Portal 7.5 and 7.6 looming in November 2020, we were looking at ways to help customers make the jump to the latest 7.7 update.​

The `/path/placeholder.js` is a cumulative script that you can use to upgrade an environment from 7.5.x or 7.6.x to the latest 7.7 update​.

### CentOS 8​ support

We have expanded official support to include CentOS 8 for the standalone (non-docker) installation of API Portal. ​

Supporting CentOS8 in a docker container is not yet supported.​

### UI/UX improvements

User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) improvements in this release:

* Better filtering options available to **User** roles on the applications catalog to allow easier searching and management of large catalogs​.
* New API state indicators for *Published* and *Unpublished* to make the current status of the endpoint clearer.
* Improved visibility of *Deprecated* APIs​.

## Limitations of this update

This update has the following limitations:

* API Portal 7.7.20200730 is compatible with API Gateway and API Manager 7.7.20200730 only.
* Upgrade to API Portal 7.7.20200730 is supported from API Portal 7.7.0 only. To upgrade from earlier versions (for example, 7.5.x, 7.6.x) you must first upgrade to API Portal 7.7.
* The ready-made API Portal Docker image 7.7.20200730 is strictly for development environments only, and it is not recommended for use in production environments.

    It is not recommended to use the image in production environments because the image is built with CentOS as a base OS, and our Axway security scans have detected multiple security concerns with this OS. We continue to monitor the latest versions of this base OS to determine if these issues have been resolved, but until we can ship a hardened image that passes our security concerns, we cannot advise customers to use this image in a production environment. A Docker image for production use is already planned in the [API Portal 2020 roadmap](https://community.axway.com/s/api-portal).
* Upgrading from previous API Portal Docker image is not supported.
* This update is not available as a virtual appliance or as a managed service on Axway Cloud.

## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

### Page layout and alignment for Arabic language

Changing the API Portal language to Arabic (or any other right to left language) results in issues with page layout and alignment on the API Portal Home and Pricing pages, and some buttons are not visible. As a workaround, you can turn on the development mode in JAI. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI).
2. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Templates**.
3. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III * Default`) to open it.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Change **Development Mode** to `ON`.
6. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.
