  required security, quota and endpoint materials to correctly consume the API.

## Subscription workflow

1. An administrator creates one or more usage plans on AWS API Gateway that provides the necessary security feature (API key / authorizer) and quota, if needed.
2. An administrator adds associated API stages to the usage plan(s).
3. A consumer initiates the subscription in AMPLIFY Central:

   1. Open an AMPLIFY Catalog item.
   2. Click **Subscribe**.
   3. Select a Team and usage plan for which you wish to subscribe. **WARNING**: The subscription will fail if you select a usage plan for which no API stages have been added. For additional information, see [Manage AMPLIFY Catalog subscriptions](/docs/catalog/manage_subscriptions/index.html).
4. The Discovery Agent receives the subscription event:

   Subscription status: **Subscribing...**

   1. Associate the API to the selected application.
   2. Add a tag `Subscriptions-<subscriptionID from AMPLIFY Central>` with the value `<apiId>-<Apistage>` on the usage plan.
   3. Send back the subscription status.

   Subscription status: **Active**

   * If failure, subscription status: **Subscription failed**. Refer to the Discovery Agent log for more information. You can delete the subscription and start again from Step 2.
5. The subscriber consumes the API:

   * The API can be consumed once the subscription details are received.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Depending on the poll interval settings for the Discovery Agent, it will take a little time from when the user subscribes an API to a usage plan until AMPLIFY Central shows the subscription state of **Active**. This is because of the time it takes to discover the change on API Manager and send events back and forth between API Manager and AMPLIFY Central.{{< /alert >}}

## Unsubscribe workflow

1. A consumer initiates unsubscribe:

   1. Open the AMPLIFY Catalog and navigate to the **Subscription** tab.
   2. Unsubscribe from the active subscription.  For additional information, see [Manage AMPLIFY Catalog subscriptions](/docs/catalog/manage_subscriptions/index.html).

2. The Discovery Agent receives the Unsubscribe event:

   * The `subscriptions-<subscriptionID from AMPLIFY Central>` is removed from the usage plan.
   * Initiates an unsubscribe to AMPLIFY Central for that Catalog item.
   * The subscription status is set to **Unsubscribed**.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Depending on the poll interval settings for the Discovery Agent, it will take a little time from when the user unsubscribes an API until AMPLIFY Central shows the subscription state of **Unsubscribed**. This is because of the time it takes to discover the change on API Manager and send events back and forth between API Manager and AMPLIFY Central.{{< /alert >}}
